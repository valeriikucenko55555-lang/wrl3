1. The Moon originated from the "Giant Impact Hypothesis," formed 4.5 billion years ago after a massive collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.

2. It is about 1/6th the size of Earth, with a diameter of 3,474 km, and has a thin exosphere, primarily composed of hydrogen, neon, and helium, making it inhospitable for life.

3. The Moon's surface features include craters, mountains, valleys, and "maria" (solidified lava seas), with the South Poleâ€“Aitken basin being one of the largest impact craters in the solar system.

4. The Moon's gravitational pull affects Earth's ocean tides and gradually slows Earth's rotation while increasing the Moon-Earth distance by about 3.8 cm per year.

5. Future exploration plans by NASA, ESA, and private companies aim to establish lunar bases and extract resources for sustained human presence and as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.
